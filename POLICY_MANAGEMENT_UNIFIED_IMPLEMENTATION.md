# 🎯 **Unified Policy Management Implementation**

## **Overview**
The Policy Management functionality has been unified across all panels (CBO, RBH, BH) to provide the **exact same interface and functionality** that you see in the CBO panel. Now when you click the Policy button in RBH and BH panels, you'll get the same comprehensive Policy Management interface.

## ✅ **What's Now Working**

### **1. Unified Policy Management Interface**
- **CBO Panel**: Uses `PolicyActivity` ✅
- **RBH Panel**: Now uses `PolicyActivity` ✅  
- **BH Panel**: Now uses `PolicyActivity` ✅

### **2. Same Functionality Across All Panels**
All three panels now provide:
- **Add Policy**: Upload files, select loan types, vendor banks
- **View Policies**: Browse existing policies with filtering
- **Policy Management**: Full CRUD operations
- **File Upload**: Document attachment support
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced policy search capabilities

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified**

#### **1. Business Head Panel**
- **File**: `BusinessHeadPanelActivity.java`
- **Change**: Policy card now navigates to `PolicyActivity` instead of `BusinessHeadPolicyManagementActivity`
- **Navigation**: Passes `SOURCE_PANEL = "BH_PANEL"` for proper back navigation

#### **2. Regional Business Head Panel**  
- **File**: `RegionalBusinessHeadPanelActivity.java`
- **Change**: Policy card now navigates to `PolicyActivity` instead of `RBHPolicyManagementActivity`
- **Navigation**: Passes `SOURCE_PANEL = "RBH_PANEL"` for proper back navigation

#### **3. Policy Activity**
- **File**: `PolicyActivity.java`
- **Change**: Added support for `BH_PANEL` in `goBack()` method
- **Result**: Business Head users can now navigate back to their panel properly

### **Navigation Flow**

```
CBO Panel → Policy Card → PolicyActivity → Back to CBO Panel
RBH Panel → Policy Card → PolicyActivity → Back to RBH Panel  
BH Panel  → Policy Card → PolicyActivity → Back to BH Panel
```
