# Business Head Panel Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a separate app/panel specifically for Business Head users in the KfinOne application. The system automatically detects users with the "Business Head" designation and provides them with a specialized dashboard and management tools.

## Database Structure

### Tables Used
- `tbl_user` - Contains user information with `designation_id` field
- `tbl_designation` - Contains designation information with `designation_name` field

### Key Relationships
- `tbl_user.designation_id` â†’ `tbl_designation.id`
- Users with designation "Business Head" are automatically detected

## API Endpoints

### 1. Business Head Users API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/get_business_head_users.php`

**Purpose:** Fetches all Business Head users and their team members

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Business Head users fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "business_head_users": [...],
    "team_members": [...],
    "statistics": {
      "total_business_head_users": 2,
      "active_business_head_users": 2,
      "total_team_members": 15,
      "active_team_members": 14
    }
  },
  "counts": {
    "business_head_users_count": 2,
    "team_members_count": 15
  }
}
```

### 2. Business Head User Detection API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/check_business_head_user.php?username={username}`

**Purpose:** Checks if a specific user is a Business Head

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "is_business_head": true,
  "message": "User is a Business Head",
  "user_data": {
    "id": "123",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "username": "business_head_user",
    "email_id": "john.doe@company.com",
    "mobile": "1234567890",
    "designation_name": "Business Head",
    "status": "Active"
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Login API
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/login.php`

**Purpose:** Login with automatic Business Head detection

**Response includes:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "is_business_head": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "123",
    "username": "business_head_user",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "designation_name": "Business Head"
  }
}
```

4. Menu provides additional options

### 3. Data Loading
1. Panel loads Business Head statistics on startup
2. Real-time data fetching from APIs
3. Error handling for network issues
4. Loading states for better UX

## Technical Implementation

### 1. API Integration
- RESTful API calls using HttpURLConnection
- JSON parsing with org.json library
- Async operations using ExecutorService

- ProgressBar for loading states
- Toast messages for user feedback

### 3. Navigation
- Intent-based navigation
- Activity lifecycle management
- Back button handling
- Proper activity stack management

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication
- Secure login validation
- Session management
- Role-based access control
- Secure logout functionality

### 2. Data Protection
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Secure API communication

## Testing
