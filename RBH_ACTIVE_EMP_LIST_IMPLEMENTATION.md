# RBH Active Emp List Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature allows Regional Business Head (RBH) users to view all active employees who were created by them. When a Regional Business Head logs into their panel and clicks on the "Total Emp" card, they are taken to a new panel that displays an "Active Emp List" with all users who have their ID in the `createdBy` column of the `tbl_user` table.

- JSON parsing error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for missing data

### Code Quality
- Follows Android development best practices
- Proper separation of concerns
