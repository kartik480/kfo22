# Regional Business Head (RBH) Panel Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a new Regional Business Head (RBH) panel for the KfinOne Android application. The RBH panel is designed for users with the designation "Regional Business Head" in the database.

## Database Structure
The RBH detection is based on the following database tables:
- `tbl_user` - Contains user information with `designation_id` field
- `tbl_designation` - Contains designation information with `designation_name` field

The system identifies RBH users by matching `tbl_user.designation_id` with `tbl_designation.id` where `tbl_designation.designation_name = 'Regional Business Head'`.

## API Endpoints Created

### 1. Get RBH Users API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/get_rbh_users.php`

**Purpose:** Fetches all Regional Business Head users and their team members.

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Regional Business Head users fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "rbh_users": [...],
    "team_members": [...],
    "statistics": {
      "total_rbh_users": 3,
      "active_rbh_users": 3,
      "total_team_members": 45,
      "active_team_members": 42
    }
  },
  "count": {
    "rbh_users": 3,
    "team_members": 45
  }
}
```

### 2. Check RBH User API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/check_rbh_user.php?username=USERNAME`

**Purpose:** Checks if a specific user is a Regional Business Head.

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "is_rbh": true,
  "message": "User is a Regional Business Head",
  "user_data": {
    "id": "32",
    "firstName": "CHIRANJEEVI",
    "lastName": "NARLAGIRI",
    "username": "chiranjeevi",
    "designation_name": "Regional Business Head",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### For RBH Users
1. Login with RBH credentials
2. System automatically detects RBH designation
3. Redirected to RBH panel dashboard
4. Access team management and other features

### For Developers
1. Test APIs using `test_rbh_panel.html`
2. RBH users are identified by designation "Regional Business Head"
3. All RBH-specific activities follow naming convention `RBH*Activity.java`
4. Layouts follow naming convention `activity_rbh_*.xml`

## Database Queries

### RBH User Detection
```sql
SELECT u.*, d.designation_name 
FROM tbl_user u 
INNER JOIN tbl_designation d ON u.designation_id = d.id 
WHERE d.designation_name = 'Regional Business Head'
AND (u.status = 'Active' OR u.status = 1 OR u.status IS NULL OR u.status = '')
```

### Team Members Query
```sql
SELECT u.*, d.designation_name, CONCAT(m.firstName, ' ', m.lastName) as managerName
FROM tbl_user u
INNER JOIN tbl_designation d ON u.designation_id = d.id
INNER JOIN tbl_user m ON u.reportingTo = m.id
INNER JOIN tbl_designation md ON m.designation_id = md.id
WHERE md.designation_name = 'Regional Business Head'
AND (u.status = 'Active' OR u.status = 1 OR u.status IS NULL OR u.status = '')
```

## Security Considerations
- All API endpoints include proper CORS headers
- User authentication required for all RBH features
- Designation-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

## Performance Notes
- API responses are optimized with proper indexing
- Android activities use efficient RecyclerView for lists
- Background processing for API calls
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time performance metrics
2. **Team Collaboration**: In-app messaging and notifications
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile-specific features
4. **Integration**: Connect with external business systems
5. **Reporting**: Advanced reporting and export capabilities
