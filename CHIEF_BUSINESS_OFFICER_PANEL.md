# Chief Business Officer Panel Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a separate app/panel specifically for Chief Business Officer (CBO) users in the KfinOne application. The system automatically detects users with the "Chief Business Officer" designation and provides them with a specialized dashboard and management tools.

## Database Structure

### Tables Used
- `tbl_user` - Contains user information with `designation_id` field
- `tbl_designation` - Contains designation information with `designation_name` field

### Key Relationships
- `tbl_user.designation_id` â†’ `tbl_designation.id`
- Users with designation "Chief Business Officer" are automatically detected

## API Endpoints

### 1. Chief Business Officer Users API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/get_chief_business_officer_users.php`

**Purpose:** Fetches all Chief Business Officer users and their team members

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Chief Business Officer data fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "cbo_users": [...],

    "statistics": {
      "total_cbo_users": 2,
      "total_team_members": 15
    }
  },
  "counts": {
    "cbo_users_count": 2,
    "team_members_count": 15
  }
}
```

### 2. CBO User Detection API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/check_cbo_user.php?username={username}`

**Purpose:** Checks if a specific user is a Chief Business Officer

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "is_cbo": true,
  "message": "User is a Chief Business Officer",
  "user_data": {...}
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Login API
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/login.php`

**Purpose:** Login with automatic CBO detection

**Response includes:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "is_chief_business_officer": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "123",
    "username": "cbo_user",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "designation_name": "Chief Business Officer"

## Login Flow Integration

### Enhanced Login Detection
The login system has been enhanced to automatically detect Chief Business Officer users:

1. **Login Request:** User submits username/password
2. **Database Query:** System queries user with designation information
3. **CBO Detection:** Checks if `designation_name` equals "Chief Business Officer"
4. **Response:** Returns `is_chief_business_officer: true/false`
5. **Navigation:** Android app routes to appropriate panel

### Code Changes
- **EnhancedLoginActivity.java:** Added CBO detection logic
- **login.php:** Enhanced to include designation information in response

## AndroidManifest.xml Updates

Added new activities to the manifest:
```xml
<!-- Chief Business Officer Activities -->
<activity
    android:name=".ChiefBusinessOfficerPanelActivity"
    android:exported="false"
    android:label="Chief Business Officer Dashboard"
    android:theme="@style/Theme.KfinOneApp" />
<activity
    android:name=".CBOTeamActivity"
    android:exported="false"
    android:label="CBO Team Management"
    android:parentActivityName=".ChiefBusinessOfficerPanelActivity" />
<!-- ... other CBO activities -->
```

   - Verify designation exists in `tbl_designation`
   - Check user's `designation_id` in `tbl_user`
   - Ensure API endpoints are accessible

2. **Android App Navigation Issues:**
   - Verify activities are declared in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Check intent extras are properly passed
   - Ensure layout files exist

3. **API Errors:**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify table structure
   - Review error logs

### Debug Tools
- Use `test_cbo_detection.html` for API testing
- Check Android logcat for app errors
- Review server error logs for API issues

## Conclusion

The Chief Business Officer panel provides a comprehensive solution for CBO users with:
