# Managing Director My Partner Users Panel Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a dedicated panel for Managing Directors to view partner users that were created by a specific user (default: user ID 8). The system fetches data from `tbl_partner_users` and joins with `tbl_user` to display creator information.

## Database Schema

### tbl_partner_users
The main table containing partner user information with the following key columns:
- `id` - Primary key
- `username` - Partner username
- `alias_name` - Alternative name
- `first_name`, `last_name` - Partner's full name
- `Phone_number` - Contact number
- `email_id` - Email address
- `company_name` - Company information
- `department`, `designation` - Professional details
- `status` - Active/Inactive status
- `createdBy` - ID of the user who created this partner (links to tbl_user.id)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps
- And many other fields for complete partner information

### tbl_user
The user table containing creator information:
- `id` - Primary key (referenced by tbl_partner_users.createdBy)
- `firstName`, `lastName` - Creator's full name

ORDER BY pu.id DESC
```

## Android Implementation

### 1. PartnerUser Model Updates
Added `creatorName` field to the PartnerUser model:
```java
private String creatorName;

public String getCreatorName() { return creatorName != null ? creatorName : ""; }
public void setCreatorName(String creatorName) { this.creatorName = creatorName; }
```

### 2. New Activity: ManagingDirectorMyPartnerUsersActivity
- **Purpose:** Dedicated activity for Managing Directors to view their partner users
- **Features:**
  - Fetches partner users created by user ID 8 (configurable)
  - Displays comprehensive partner information
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Statistics display (total, active, inactive)
  - Action buttons for edit, delete, and view details

### 3. PartnerUserAdapter Updates
- Added `partnerCreatorName` TextView to display creator information
- Updated layout to show "Created By: [Creator Name]"

### 4. Layout Updates
- Updated `partner_user_card_item.xml` to include creator name field
- Maintains consistent design with existing partner user cards

### 5. Navigation Integration
- Updated `ManagingDirectorPartnerPanelActivity` to navigate to the new activity
- Added activity declaration in `AndroidManifest.xml`

## Key Features

### 1. Data Filtering
- Fetches only partner users created by the specified user (default: ID 8)
- Can be easily modified to accept different user IDs

### 2. Creator Information
- Joins with `tbl_user` to display creator's full name
- Shows "Created By: [Creator Name]" in each partner user card

### 3. Comprehensive Display
- Shows all relevant partner information including:
  - Personal details (name, contact, email)
  - Professional information (company, department, designation)
  - Location details (branch state, branch location)
  - Banking information (bank name, account type)
  - Status and timestamps

### 4. Search and Filter
- Real-time search across multiple fields
- Filter by status (All, Active, Inactive)
- Statistics display

### 5. Action Capabilities
- View details
- Edit partner user (placeholder for future implementation)
- Delete partner user (placeholder for future implementation)

## Testing

### Test File: `test_managing_director_my_partner_users.html`
A comprehensive test interface that:
- Tests the API endpoint with different parameters
- Displays response data in a formatted table
- Shows statistics and data analysis
- Provides error handling and validation

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Default Test:** Tests with createdBy=8
2. **Custom Test:** Allows testing with different user IDs
3. **Invalid Test:** Tests error handling with invalid parameters

## Usage Instructions

### For Managing Directors:
1. Navigate to the Managing Director Partner Panel
2. Click on "My Partner Users" box
3. View the list of partner users created by user ID 8
4. Use search and filter options to find specific users
5. Click action buttons for additional operations

### For Developers:
1. The API endpoint can be called with different `createdBy` parameters
2. The Android activity can be modified to accept dynamic user IDs
3. Additional features can be added to the action buttons

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation:** The API validates and escapes the `createdBy` parameter
2. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for database and network issues
3. **Access Control:** Should be integrated with user authentication and authorization

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic User Selection:** Allow Managing Directors to select which user's created partners to view
2. **Bulk Operations:** Add bulk edit/delete capabilities
3. **Export Functionality:** Add ability to export partner user data
4. **Advanced Filtering:** Add more filter options (date range, location, etc.)
5. **Real-time Updates:** Implement real-time data updates

## Database Tables Relationship

```
tbl_partner_users.createdBy → tbl_user.id
```

The relationship allows us to:
1. Filter partner users by creator
2. Display creator information for each partner user
3. Maintain data integrity through foreign key relationship

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete solution for Managing Directors to view partner users created by specific users. The system is scalable, maintainable, and follows Android development best practices. The API is well-documented and tested, ensuring reliable functionality.
