# Fix for 500 Error in Managing Director Partners Team API

## Issue Description

The Android app was experiencing a 500 error when trying to fetch partner users from the API endpoint:
```
https://emp.kfinone.com/mobile/api/managing_director_partners_team_new.php
```

Error log:
```
NetworkUtility.shouldRetryException: Unexpected response code 500 for https://emp.kfinone.com/mobile/api/managing_director_partners_team_new.php
Error fetching partner users: null
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a database connection problem in the PHP API files. The files were using `global $conn` to access a database connection from `db_config.php`, but there was a mismatch in variable names:

- `db_config.php` defines variables as: `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_username`, `$db_password`
- The API files were trying to use a global `$conn` variable that wasn't properly initialized

## Files Affected

1. `api/managing_director_partners_team_new.php` - Main API causing the 500 error
2. `api/managing_director_partners_team.php` - Original API file
3. `api/managing_director_my_partner_users.php` - Related API file

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Connection

Replaced the problematic `global $conn;` usage with proper database connection creation:

**Before:**
```php
try {
    global $conn;
    // ... rest of code
```

**After:**
```php
try {
    // Create a new connection using the correct variable names
    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_username, $db_password, $db_name);
    
    // Check connection
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        throw new Exception("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    
    // Set charset to utf8
    $conn->set_charset("utf8");
    
    // ... rest of code
```

### 2. Added Proper Connection Cleanup

Added a `finally` block to ensure database connections are properly closed:

```php
} finally {
    if (isset($conn)) {
        $conn->close();
    }
}
```

## Testing

Created test files to verify the fix:

1. `test_debug_partners_team_api.html` - Debug version to identify issues
2. `test_fixed_partners_team_api.html` - Test the fixed API
3. `api/managing_director_partners_team_debug.php` - Debug version of the API

## Expected Result

After applying these fixes:

1. The API should return a successful response with partner users data
2. The Android app should be able to fetch and display partner users
3. No more 500 errors should occur

## Additional Notes

- The same database connection issue likely affects other API files in the project
- A systematic review of all files using `global $conn` should be conducted
- Consider standardizing the database connection approach across all API files

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified Files:
- `api/managing_director_partners_team_new.php` - Fixed database connection
- `api/managing_director_partners_team.php` - Fixed database connection  
- `api/managing_director_my_partner_users.php` - Fixed database connection

### Created Files:
- `api/managing_director_partners_team_debug.php` - Debug version
- `test_debug_partners_team_api.html` - Debug test file
- `test_fixed_partners_team_api.html` - Fixed API test file
- `FIX_500_ERROR_PARTNERS_TEAM_API.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixed API endpoints
2. Verify the Android app can successfully fetch partner users
3. Consider applying similar fixes to other API files with the same issue
4. Update the database configuration approach for consistency
